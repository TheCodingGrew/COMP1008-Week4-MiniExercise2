# Instructions  

# Program 1
 You would like to give away an awesome prize to one lucky 
person in the class that is selected randomly.
  ## Step 1:
  ```
  In Main.java, Write a program that lets the user type in names. Each 
name that is entered should be stored in an ArrayList of 
type String. When the word "quit" is entered then the 
program should stop inputting names. 

Tip: Use while/do-while loop
```

## Step 2:
```
Print a list of all contestants using a “enhanced for” loop to 
display the contents of your ArrayList
```

## Step 3:

```
Then your program should generate a random number 
that could be any entry in the ArrayList and print out the 
name of the lucky winner.

The logic to generate random number is given here: https://replit.com/@TheCodingGrew/GenerateRandomNumber#Main.java

If the random number generated is 2, the name at position 2 is the winner !
```

## Step 4: 
```
Draw a second winner. After a person has won - remove him from the list by using the remove method
```

## Step 5:
```
Generate random number again and declare the second winner
